# Pattern Recognition

These classifiers are mainly used for data vizualizatiin, manipulation and plotting. Several data sets are used for training and testing the models. Data are plotted in the graph to figure out the result of testing in comparison with testing with the help of these algorithms.

## Naive Bayes Algorithm 
Data is predicted successfully according to naive bayes algorithm.

## Minimum Distance to Class Mean Classifier
It has classified the test dataset to it's desired classes according to the train dataset considering the minimum distance.

## Perceptron Algorithm
This algorithm is used for batch processing (many at a time) and single processing (one at a time) and result is showed in a graph.

## Minimum Error Rate Classifier
A minimum error rate classifier for a two class problem has been designed considering they follow the normal distribution.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 
Datasets are classified accurately based on this algorithm where user can input the nearest neighbor count so that dataset is classified according to the number of nearest neighbours which is also taken as user-input.

## K-Means Clustering
Datasets are clustered successfully according to K-means clustering algorithm.
