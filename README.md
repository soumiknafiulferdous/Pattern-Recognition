# Pattern Recognition

These classifiers are mainly used for data visualization, manipulation and plotting. Several datasets are used for training and testing the models. Data are plotted in the graph to figure out the result of testing in comparison with training with the help of these algorithms.

## Naive Bayes Algorithm 
Data is predicted successfully using the naive bayes algorithm.

## Minimum Distance to Class Mean Classifier
It can classify the test dataset in it's desired classes according to the train dataset considering the minimum distance.

## Perceptron Algorithm
This algorithm is used for batch processing (many at a time) and single processing (one at a time) and result is showed in a graph.

## Minimum Error Rate Classifier
A minimum error rate classifier for a two-class problem has been designed considering they follow the normal distribution.

## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) 

At first, determine parameter K = number of nearest neighbors and calculate the distance between the query-instance and all the training samples. Then, sort the distance and determine nearest neighbors based on the K-th minimum distance. After that, gather the category of the nearest neighbors and use simple majority of the category of nearest neighbors as the prediction value of the query instance. Then the dataset is classified accurately based on this algorithm where user can input the number of nearest neighbors and the dataset is classified according to that number.

## K-Means Clustering

For  K-means clustering, determine number of cluster K at first and assume the centroid or center of these clusters. Then take any random objects as the initial centroids or the first K objects in sequence that can also serve as the initial centroids. After that, plot all the points. Perform the k-means clustering algorithm applying Euclidean distance as a distance measure on the given dataset with k=2. Color the corresponding points on the clusters with different colors. Finally, the dataset is clustered successfully according to K-means clustering algorithm.
